Apache Airflow is an open-source platform 
used to programmatically author, schedule, 
and monitor workflows, primarily for data engineering 
pipelines (ETL/ELT). Workflows are defined as Python-based 
Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), enabling complex 
task dependencies, retries, and monitoring via a web UI.
